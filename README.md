# WELCOME TO LIDAR TECHNOLOGY
We are living in exciting time and the field of spatial dat is growing into a beautiful multidisciplinary avenue in making things run in the world. 
From the old shapefile that have served a great insight in establishing the field of GIS to recent data formats. LiDAR operaions is not left behind. It is here with us offering new insight into point cloud data.
Invite you to consider the stem of knowledge into this field by plunging into the beautiful content that I have uploaded into this repository.
# MY JOURNEY WITH LIDAR
I am currently doing a unit called Digital mapping(SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER, 2024). Our lecturer has introduced us to LAStools and its amazing seeing what the tool can do. Am amazed to see classification and how data is manipulated in the tool. 

LAStools consist of different parts:
1. LASlib, the low level processing API.
2. LASzip, the compressing/decompressing API.
Both parts are for free and open source.

LAStools toolset.
Additional tools based on LASlib and LASzip for processing LiDAR data.
Some of the tools are free to use, others are licensed.

To access the gem of this tool, feel free to go to
