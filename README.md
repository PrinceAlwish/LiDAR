# WELCOME TO LIDAR TECHNOLOGY
We are living in exciting times, and the field of spatial data is evolving into a multidisciplinary avenue that powers the world. From the traditional shapefiles that have provided invaluable insights in establishing the GIS field, to recent data formats, LiDAR operations are not left behind. LiDAR technology is here, offering new insights through point cloud data.

I invite you to explore the wealth of knowledge in this field by diving into the valuable content I have uploaded to this repository.
# MY JOURNEY WITH LIDAR
I am currently taking a unit called Digital Mapping (September–December 2024). Our lecturer introduced us to LAStools, and it's amazing to see what this tool can do! I am particularly fascinated by its classification features and how data is manipulated within the tool.

LAStools consists of different components:

    LASlib – the low-level processing API.
    LASzip – the compression/decompression API.
    Both are free and open-source..

LAStools toolset.
Additional tools based on LASlib and LASzip are available for processing LiDAR data. Some tools are free to use, while others require a license.
